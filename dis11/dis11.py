# define-macro allows us to define whatâ€™s known as a macro,
# which is simply a way for us to combine unevaluated input expressions together into another expression.

# We evaluated lambda procedures in the following way:
# 1. Evaluate operator
# 2. Evaluate operands
# 3. Apply operator to operands, evaluating the body of the procedure

# However, the rules for evaluating calls to macro procedures are:
# 1. Evaluate operator
# 2. Apply operator to unevaluated operands
# 3. Evaluate the expression returned by the macro in the frame it was called in.
